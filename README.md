# React + Vite

This template provides a minimal setup to get React working in Vite with HMR and some ESLint rules.

Currently, two official plugins are available:

- [@vitejs/plugin-react](https://github.com/vitejs/vite-plugin-react/blob/main/packages/plugin-react) uses [Babel](https://babeljs.io/) for Fast Refresh
- [@vitejs/plugin-react-swc](https://github.com/vitejs/vite-plugin-react/blob/main/packages/plugin-react-swc) uses [SWC](https://swc.rs/) for Fast Refresh

## React Compiler

The React Compiler is currently not compatible with SWC. See [this issue](https://github.com/vitejs/vite-plugin-react/issues/428) for tracking the progress.

## Expanding the ESLint configuration

If you are developing a production application, we recommend using TypeScript with type-aware lint rules enabled. Check out the [TS template](https://github.com/vitejs/vite/tree/main/packages/create-vite/template-react-ts) for information on how to integrate TypeScript and [`typescript-eslint`](https://typescript-eslint.io) in your project.

# üìò React + Vite Learning Repository

This repository is my structured learning hub for mastering **React** with **Vite**.  
It documents my progress through hands‚Äëon topics, projects, and experiments, serving as both a **knowledge base** and a **reference guide** for modern frontend development.

## üìö Project Structure & Approach

This repository is organized as a **learning portfolio** for React + Vite.  
Each new concept or mini‚Äëproject lives inside its own folder under `src/topics/`.  

Key features of this approach:
- **Shared Layout** ‚Üí A common `Layout` component provides a consistent navbar and footer across all pages.
- **Dynamic Imports** ‚Üí Topics are lazy‚Äëloaded using `React.lazy` and `Suspense`, so each page loads only when visited.
- **Auto‚ÄëGenerated Topics Index** ‚Üí The `/topics` route automatically lists all available topics by reading from a central config (or via Vite‚Äôs `import.meta.glob`), so adding a new topic requires no manual router edits.
